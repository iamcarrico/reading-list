# Haruki Murakami

## Books

* The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle
* 1Q84
  * I've read this once twice. Some *very* small science fiction aspects; if you aren't paying attention you'll miss them. Relatively complex story revolving around two main characters, that connect at the end.
* Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage
  * The newest book. Easier to read overall.
