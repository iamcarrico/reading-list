My Reading List
---------------

I like to read, and realized that I need to keep a list of what I have read, and what I want to read in the future. There are a lot of books out there.

## What can I do to help?

Have a book you really like? Open a PR with adding the book to the list. I only ask that you add it with a reason why you like it, and where I can get it. If I have already read it, I will try and add my thoughts on it. If not, I will add it to the list.

## Topics?

I tend to read books on the following topics. Although this can serve as a guide, by no means do I restrict myself to just these.

* International Politics / Relations
* History
* General Literature
* Economic Theory


I will try to add more, as well as my full current list as I keep going.
